# Bengaluru_house_price_predictor
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru, leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze various factors that influence real estate values. The dataset includes features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. Explore the repository for detailed analysis and predictive models.
## Project Structure
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Source: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle/Bengaluru House Data.

Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to better represent the data.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Analysis: Identifying key trends and patterns in the data, such as the effect of location or the number of bedrooms on house prices.
### Model Building
Regression Models: Implementing various regression techniques such as:
Linear Regression,
Ridge Regression,
Lasso Regression.

Model Evaluation: Using metric RÂ² score to evaluate model performance.
